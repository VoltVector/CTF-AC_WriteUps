## Escaping Barcelona
#misc

`We must leave this planet at exactly 18:00 UTC+2 on 7th of November 2025. Leaving from Barcelona so act quick and give me the distance to Mars.
`
To solve this challenge, we can use NASA's Horizons System tool (available at https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/) to calculate the distance between the given point (Barcelona) and Mars. By entering the time details, we are able to achieve an accurate window for getting the distance to Mars.
