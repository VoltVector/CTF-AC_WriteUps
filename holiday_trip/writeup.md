While this doesn't seem to be a tough to find location, the amount of beach areas that could
be tested are plenty. The first ones that we tried are popular Romanian locations (like "mamaia").
Nothing seemed to be close for what we were searching, until we discovered this clue (through Yandex):

While the comment translated is not necessarily nice (along with the mugs), it pointed us to the
Bulgarian shore. The first guess whas Balchik (along with others like Nesebar), however the websites
that promoted the popular Bulgarian coastline, included many atractions, one of them being **Golden Sands**.
We tried it, and we got the flag.
